Setting up a Custom Dock


Method 1: Docutil

Pros: Allows the end user to add items to the Dock after removing and adding default applications
Cons: Does not lock the applications to the dock, end users can remove the apps as needed, provides the most flexibility. Also has the possibility to duplicate applications (icons only) if they are not installed prior to installation

How to Guide

Manually

1. Download Docutil from Github https://github.com/kcrawford/dockutil/releases
2. Install Docutil on your device/s of choice
3. Create a script that will add and remove applications that you do not need or want
	3. My script can be found above
4. Adjust the script to have the applications that you want to be docked
5. Place script on the target machine
	a. Change the script permissions to be executable (chmod +x â€œScriptname.sh)
	b. Run the script to execute custom dock

Note: If docked applications are not on the machine it will show up as a question mark.
Note: If custom script for applications is the wrong path it will show up as a question mark.
Note: If application is downloaded after script is ran, it can cause a duplicate of the application in the dock.
